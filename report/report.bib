  journal = {http://2011.eclipse-it.org/ProcEclipse-IT11/},
  year = {2011},
  note = {This paper presents the motivation, design, and implementation of a projectional editor for Eclipse based on EMF. It describes how one can have more than one notation per projection. Furthermore, a case study revolving around a mathematical DSL shows how DSLs can be created and used through this tool.}

  journal = {University of Pensylvania, Departmental Papers},
  year = {2005},
  note = {This paper presents a possible solution to the view-update problem using “lenses”. Lenses are bi-directional transformations on trees, expressed in a DSL called Harmony. Harmony works as a framework for synchronizing tree structures, and propagating changes between different copies of the same tree, and possibly even of different formats.}
