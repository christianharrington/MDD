\section{Evaluation}
\label{sec:evaluation}
In this section we evaluate the solution, with reference to each of the requirements in Section \ref{subsec:requirements}. Furthermore, we discuss the methods used to verify the correctness of the prototype.

\subsection{Requirements Evaluation}
\label{subsec:requirements_evaluation}
\subsubsection{Working with a Partial Model}
We are capable of extracting partial IFC models, and subsequently updating these by using the Pipes DSL. In Section \ref{subsec:problem_analysis} we presented the informal IFC subset definition that we extract, and in Figure \ref{fig:pipes_dsl_ecore_model} we depicted the corresponding Pipes DSL meta model. We focus on a simple partial model, but it would be possible to extend this if other IFC objects were to be added. We have ensured modularity by implementing the extraction process as a modular workflow component. Hence, the extraction process is verifiable as confirmed by the automated tests described in Section \ref{subsec:verification_methods}.

\subsubsection{Correct Meta Model} As explained in Section \ref{subsec:ifc_meta_model} the prototype uses the official ifcXML XSD to generate an Ecore meta model that is both correct and replaceable in theory. However, there are certain serious drawbacks to this solution.

EMF does not seem to handle the large IFC meta models very well. In our experience, the IFC meta model generated from the IFC XSD, would be incomplete with certain methods not being auto-generated (eUnset methods for fields in some entity classes). Also, EMF will auto-generated methods that exceed the maximum size allowed by the Java Development Kit (64kB)\footnote{JDK bug 4262078: \url{http://bugs.sun.com/view_bug.do?bug_id=4262078}}. While it is possible to work around such problems, it is not viable the auto-generated code has to be fixed.

The default resource deserialiser is too slow for working with an instance of a realistic IFC model. A real-world model can easily give load and save times of more than ten minutes. The EMF site lists some performance tips that should solve these problems.\footnote{EMF Performance Tips: \url{http://www.eclipse.org/modeling/emf/docs/performance/EMFPerformanceTips.html}}\footnote{Performance and Extensibility with EMF: \url{http://www.slideshare.net/kenn.hussey/performance-and-extensibility-with-emf}}, but in our experience the improvement was minimal if any. In effect, all our tests have been are carried out using smaller subsets of IFC. We conclude that EMF is not good for handling meta models of more than 2,000 elements.

\subsubsection{Valid Model Transformations} The Xtend-based model-to-model transformation from the partial IFC model to the Pipes model builds on a set of transformation rules. Validation of the transformation should therefore be reduced to evaluating these rules. We verify that the transformation on rules for each of the objects in the target model is correct (see Appendix \ref{app:automatedtests}).

Similarly, the model-to-text transformation from the Pipes model instance to the .pipes syntax is based on a series of Xpand rules. The verification of this transformation is carried out as a part of the black box test described in \ref{subsec:verification_methods} and Appendix \ref{app:blackboxtests}, as the generated Pipes DSL editor will highlight any syntax errors in the Pipes DSL code.

\subsubsection{A Simple DSL} Section \ref{subsec:pipes_dsl} describes the benefits of the DSL implementation. It serves as a proof of concept that other subdomains of IFC can be edited in the same way. Being a modular component of the entire prototype, the textual Pipes DSL implementation could be substituted with a visual one.

\subsubsection{Structural Editing} The structural editing on the partial model has, by far, been the most difficult unit of work in this project. Deleting elements is fairly simple, but a simple cleanup routine had to be implemented as the EMF still lets the model root element preserve a reference to the object even when marked for deletion. Adding elements to the model, however, turned out give rise to some serialisation issues. Specifically, elements added to the model were serialised differently from other, similar ifcXML entities.

\subsection{Verification Methods}
\label{subsec:verification_methods}
We have implemented an automated test suite for verifying that our transformation components work as desired. The IFC elements extractor, IFC2Pipes model transformation and the updating features of the Pipes2IFC Transformer components (see Figure \ref{fig:Pipes2IFCWorkflow}) are the most interesting to validate, as these are the central components containing most of the transformation logic. Furthermore, black box tests of the entire prototype have been conducted with X (FIXME) input test buildings. These tests check that both the IFC model and the Pipes model is left in a valid state after running each workflow component. The results of the tests can be found in Appendices \ref{app:blackboxtests} and \ref{app:automatedtests}.

\subsection{Threats to validity}
\subsubsection{Internal Validity} When a prototype is primarily black box tested, it is natural to question the correctness of all the individual components. However, we will argue that it is highly likely that any internal errors, undiscoverable by the black box tests, will either be discovered by the automated tests or result in program crashes, as the workflow components are highly modular with well defined interfaces.

Using EMF we have encountered a substantial amount of technical difficulties related only to the Eclipse IDE and its modelling tools. We identify these tools as an internal threat to the validity of the prototype, as our trust in them has been decreasing over the course of the project.

\subsubsection{External Validity} Retrieving building models for testing has been challenging. Given the fact that most modern visual BIM tools are very complex, we were unable to produce meaningful construction and plumbing models for testing ourselves, and had to rely on external contacts for providing test models (see Section \ref{sec:conclusion}). That means X (FIXME) example models were used for testing, which is considered sufficient, but not optimal. More tests with more example models must be performed to solidify the claim of general applicability of the prototype to all building models.
