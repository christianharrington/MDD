\section{Evaluation}
\label{sec:evaluation}
In this section we evaluate the solution, with reference to the requirements of Section \ref{subsec:requirements}. Furthermore, we discuss the methods used to verify the correctness of the product. Recall that a usability evaluation of the Pipes DSL is outside the scope of the project as also described in Section \ref{subsec:requirements}. We conclude the section by evaluating our use of EMF for this particular domain.

% Maybe: Discussion of applicability of product. What should be done in order to make this project usable in a real world scenario?

\subsection{Requirements Evaluation}
\label{subsec:requirements_evaluation}
\paragraph{Working with a Partial Model} By using MWE2 workflows we are able to modularize the individual steps of the prototype. This achieves reusability and verifiability of each of the modular components. Note how, several workflow components have been reused in both workflows. We presented the informal IFC subset definition that we desired in Section \ref{subsec:problem_analysis}, but probably the most expressive depiction of the problem domain was achieved by creating the simple Ecore meta model in Figure \ref{fig:pipes_dsl_ecore_model}.

\paragraph{Correct Meta Model} As explained in Section \ref{subsec:ifc_meta_model} the prototype uses the official IFC XSD to generate an Ecore metamodel that is both correct and easily updatable. However, there were certain serious drawbacks to this solution.

During this project, we encountered several problems with EMF, which we believe are due to the large size of the IFC meta model. Our meta model for IFC was generated from the XSD for the ifcXML. During this generation, several bugs were encountered, such as some methods not being generated (FIXME: reference), and methods exceeding the maximal size allowed by the Java Virtual Machine (FIXME: reference). While we were able to work around these bugs after some effort, they indicated that EMF had trouble handling meta models of this size (more than 2,000 elements).

When working with an instance of a realistic model, we experienced load and save times in excess of 10 minutes using the default XML resource deserializer. Several optimization methods were tried\footnote{EMF Performance Tips from EMF documentation can be found at \url{http://www.eclipse.org/modeling/emf/docs/performance/EMFPerformanceTips.html}}\footnote{Performance and Extensibility with EMF can be found at \url{http://www.slideshare.net/kenn.hussey/performance-and-extensibility-with-emf}} to no effect. We decided to test with smaller subsets of the test models (buildings) we had available.

Given the nature of the problems we experienced, and the large size of the IFC metamodel and usual building instance models, it would be appropriate to look into other modelling frameworks, or alternatively, attempt to minimise the size of the models.

\paragraph{Valid Model Transformations} The Xtend based model to model transformation from the partial IFC model to the Pipes model builds on a set of conversion rules. Validation of the transformation should therefore be reduced to the evaluation of these rules. We verify verify that each EClass of the target model has a corresponding rule. (TODO do test?) 

Similarly, the model to text transformation from Pipes model instance to .pipes text format is based on a series of Xpand rules. Verifying this transformation is carried out as a part of the black box test described in \ref{subsec:verification_methods}, as the static checker of the generated Eclipse editor will spot any invalid text.

\paragraph{A Simple DSL} Section \ref{subsec:pipes_dsl} describes the benefits of the particular DSL implementation of the prototype. It serves as a proof of concept that other subdomains of IFC can be edited in the same way. Being a modular component of the entire prototype the textual Pipes language implementation could be substituted with a visual one.

\paragraph{Structural Editing} The structural editing on the partial model has, by far, been the most difficult unit of work in this project. Deleting elements is fairly simple, but a simple garbage collector had to be implemented as the EMF utility still lets the model root element preserve a reference to the object even when marked for deletion by the user. Adding elements, on the other hand, is a complex task when working with an EMF model instance. (TODO write how we solved the problem of adding)


\subsection{Verification Methods}
\label{subsec:verification_methods}
Due to the nature of the prototype an extensive and automated test suite for each MWE2 workflow component is infeasible. Only the synchronization features of the Main Model Updater component is interesting to validate, as it is the central component containing most, if not all, workflow logic.

Two approaches have been used to ensure the correctness of the prototype. Firstly, a minor Xtend unit test suite has been written to verify the synchronization happening in the Main Model Updater. Secondly, a black box test of the entire prototype has been conducted with X (FIXME) input test building. The test results of these can be found in Appendix X (TODO insert ref) and cover both structural changes on pipes and openings and attribute updates on all types of objects within the domain.

\subsection{Threats to validity}
\paragraph{Internal Validity} When mostly black box testing a prototype it is natural to question the correctness of all the individual components. However, we will argue that it is highly likely that any internal errors will result in either program crashes or inconsistencies discoverable by the black box tests, as the workflow components are highly modular with well defined interfaces.

Using EMF with all its tools and languages we have encountered an unusual amount of technical difficulties related only to Eclipse IDE and its modelling tools. We identify these components as an internal threat to the validity of the prototype, as our trust in them has been decreasing.

\paragraph{External Validity} Retrieving test buildings for the black box tests has been challenging. Given the fact that most modern visual BIM tools are very complex we were unable to produce meaningful construction and plumbing models for black box testing and had to rely on external contacts for providing test buildings (see Section \ref{sec:conclusion}). That means X (FIXME) example models were used for testing, which is considered sufficient but not optimal. More tests with more example models must be performed to solidify the claim of general applicability of the prototype to all building models.

Another concern might be that we only handle and test operations on our particular subdomain, but elements external to this domain are not paid any attention during the extraction and update processes, as they are expected to simply stay the same when untouched by our code. This assumption has not been officially confirmed.
