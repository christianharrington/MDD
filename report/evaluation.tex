\section{Evaluation}
Discussion of applicability of product. What should be done in order to make this project usable in a real world scenario?

Point out: It is not relevant to have evaluations of the usability of the textual language as it is only experimental. One would obviously make a visual editor if the product should be usable.

What were the challenges?
- Saving the subset back to the server after editing. Synchronization problem
- Using MPS: it is not a freetext editor. We would want to improve on this later. XText is not flexible enough for this purpose.



Threats to validity
Harrington point: We know that we only make changes to elements in our own domain in the IFC model and can show the correctness of the operations performed on these. But we have no way of showing that the open and save operations on the XML file work as intended. We say that our solution works correctly under the assumption that these methods work.
