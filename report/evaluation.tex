\section{Evaluation}
\label{sec:evaluation}
In this section we evaluate the solution, with reference to the requirements of Section \ref{subsec:requirements}. Furthermore, we discuss the methods used to verify the correctness of the prototype. Recall that a usability evaluation of the Pipes DSL is outside the scope of the project.

\subsection{Requirements Evaluation}
\label{subsec:requirements_evaluation}
\subsubsection{Working with a Partial Model} By using Xtend classes to define workflow components we are able to modularize the individual steps of the prototype. These steps are chained using MWE2 workflows. This achieves reusability and verifiability of each of the modular components. Note how several workflow components have been reused in both workflows. We presented the informal IFC subset definition that we desired in Section \ref{subsec:problem_analysis}, but the clearest depiction of the problem domain has been achieved by creating the simple Ecore meta model shown in Figure \ref{fig:pipes_dsl_ecore_model}.

\subsubsection{Correct Meta Model} As explained in Section \ref{subsec:ifc_meta_model} the prototype uses the official ifcXML XSD to generate an Ecore meta model that is both correct and easily updatable. However, there were certain serious drawbacks to this solution.

During this project, we encountered several problems with EMF, which we believe are due to the large size of the IFC meta model. When generating the IFC meta model, several bugs were encountered, such as some methods not being generated (eUnset methods for fields in some entity classes), and methods exceeding the maximum size allowed by the Java Development Kit (64kB)\footnote{JDK bug 4262078: \url{http://bugs.sun.com/view_bug.do?bug_id=4262078}}. While we were able to work around these bugs after some effort, they indicated that EMF had trouble handling meta models of more than 2,000 elements.

When working with an instance of a realistic model, we experienced load and save times in excess of 10 minutes using the default XML resource deserializer. Several optimization methods were tried to no effect.\footnote{EMF Performance Tips: \url{http://www.eclipse.org/modeling/emf/docs/performance/EMFPerformanceTips.html}}\footnote{Performance and Extensibility with EMF: \url{http://www.slideshare.net/kenn.hussey/performance-and-extensibility-with-emf}} We decided to test with smaller subsets of the test models we had available.

Given the nature of the problems we experienced, and the large size of both the IFC meta model and building instance models, it would be appropriate to look into other modelling frameworks.

\subsubsection{Valid Model Transformations} The Xtend-based model-to-model transformation from the partial IFC model to the Pipes model builds on a set of conversion rules. Validation of the transformation should therefore be reduced to the evaluation of these rules. We verify that each EClass of the target model has a corresponding rule (see Appendices \ref{app:blackboxtests} and \ref{app:automatedtests}).

Similarly, the model-to-text transformation from the Pipes model instance to the .pipes syntax is based on a series of Xpand rules. The verification of this transformation is carried out as a part of the black box test described in \ref{subsec:verification_methods}, as the generated Pipes DSL editor will highlight any syntax errors in the Pipes DSL code.

\subsubsection{A Simple DSL} Section \ref{subsec:pipes_dsl} describes the benefits of the particular DSL implementation of the prototype. It serves as a proof of concept that other subdomains of IFC can be edited in the same way. Being a modular component of the entire prototype, the textual Pipes DSL implementation could be substituted with a visual one.

\subsubsection{Structural Editing} The structural editing on the partial model has, by far, been the most difficult unit of work in this project. Deleting elements is fairly simple, but a simple cleanup routine had to be implemented as the EMF utility still lets the model root element preserve a reference to the object even when marked for deletion by the user. Adding elements to the model, however, turned out give rise to some serialization issues. Specifically, elements added to the model were serialized differently from other, similar ifcXML entities.

\subsection{Verification Methods}
\label{subsec:verification_methods}
Due to the nature of the prototype, an extensive and automated test suite for each workflow component is infeasible. Only IFC elements extraction, IFC2Pipes model transformation and the updating features of the Pipes2IFC Transformer components (see Figure \ref{fig:Pipes2IFCWorkflow}) are interesting to validate, as these are the central components containing most of the transformation logic. Furthermore, black box tests of the entire prototype have been conducted with X (FIXME) input test buildings. These tests check that both the IFC model and the Pipes model is left in a valid state after running each workflow component. The results of the tests can be found in Appendices \ref{app:blackboxtests} and \ref{app:automatedtests}.

\subsection{Threats to validity}
\subsubsection{Internal Validity} When a prototype is primarily black box tested, it is natural to question the correctness of all the individual components. However, we will argue that it is highly likely that any internal errors, undiscoverable by the black box tests, will either be discovered by the automated tests or result in program crashes, as the workflow components are highly modular with well defined interfaces.

Using EMF, with all its tools and languages, we have encountered an unusual amount of technical difficulties related only to the Eclipse IDE and its modelling tools. We identify these tools as an internal threat to the validity of the prototype, as our trust in them has been decreasing over the course of the project.

\subsubsection{External Validity} Retrieving test buildings for the black box tests has been challenging. Given the fact that most modern visual BIM tools are very complex, we were unable to produce meaningful construction and plumbing models for black box testing, and had to rely on external contacts for providing test buildings (see Section \ref{sec:conclusion}). That means X (FIXME) example models were used for testing, which is considered sufficient but not optimal. More tests with more example models must be performed to solidify the claim of general applicability of the prototype to all building models.

Another concern is that we only handle and test operations on our particular subdomain, but elements external to this domain are not paid any attention during the extraction, transformation and update processes, as they are expected to simply stay the same when untouched by our code. This assumption has not been officially confirmed.
