In this section we present a list of desirable features when working with projectional editing on IFC.
\paragraph{}
Design decisions we faced when making this setup. List a bunch of requirements that we can reference in the next section: 
\begin{enumerate}[itemsep=0pt,parsep=2pt,topsep=10pt]
	\item {\it Full control over projection software.} Write about: Extracting subset on server og client? Why not trying to do this on the BIMServer? We could have extended the open source project
	\item {\it Accurate ecore meta-model for IFC domain.} Using BIMServer library ecore metamodel or using XSD generated ecore metamodel
	\item {\it Proper subset definition.} How is the subset defined? MVD could have been used, but we chose not to.
	\item {\it Flexible model to model framework.} Which model2model tool to use? ATL, QVT, Xtend?
\end{enumerate}
