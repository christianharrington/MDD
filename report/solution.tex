\section{Solution}
The final product combines several technologies to attain an extendable solution with two reusable Xtend workflows at its core. The setup allows the user to edit a sub domain of IFC in a generated Eclipse editor in between the two workflows and saving the edited subset back to the main model on the BIMServer.
