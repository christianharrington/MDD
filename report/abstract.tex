REWRITE WHEN PAPER IS DONE. This paper describes how a partial IFC (Industry Foundation Classes) model can be edited with a textual editor. The partial model is extracted from an IFC model, transformed to the model of a DSL (Domain Specific Language), and synchronized back to the IFC model. We show that it is feasible to make a valid transformations of this kind, and we discuss the value of being able to work on partial models with a textual editor.
