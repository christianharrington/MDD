% Feature modeling is an important element of development of Software Product Lines. Much research exists on feature modeling languages, and feature modeling tools. It is surprising though, that no experience reports exist of using feature modeling in industrial practice, and no characteristics of industrial models is openly available.
% In this work we identify, present, and analyze two real life feature models of operating system kernels, eCos and Linux. We find that many assumptions about feature models made by tool builders in academia do not hold in reality, and thus many tools are potentially not useful; real models are substantially larger, and with higher density of constraints than previously anticipated.

REWRITE WHEN PAPER IS DONE. This paper describes how a partial IFC (Industry Foundation Classes) model can be edited with a textual editor. The partial model is extracted from an IFC model, transformed to the model of a DSL (Domain Specific Language), and synchronized back to the IFC model. We show that it is feasible to make a valid transformations of this kind, and we discuss the value of being able to work on partial models with a textual editor.
