\section{Plan For Future Projects}
%As part of this project, we have developed the following plan that could be used in future follow-up projects
\subsection{Future Work}
\label{sec:future_work}
There are several areas of this solution that can be improved. Below the improvements we prioritise the highest are summarised. 
\subsection{Meta model}
As described in Section \ref{Evaluation_EMF}, the meta model we used has several problems. Most of these problems could be solved by a better model, such as one we discovered, which is made by Jim Steel\footnote{Jim Steel's model can be found at \url{http://www.emn.fr/z-info/atlanmod/index.php/Ecore#ifc2x3_0.1}}. This model is much simpler than the one generated from the ifcXML XSD, and seems to be easier to work with. Using this model would necessitate writing serializers, which would hopefully also improve load times.
\subsection{Synchronization}
% Study these papers:
%	"Feature-Based Survey of Model Transformation Approaches",
%	"The View Update Problem for XML", 
%	"From model transformation to incremental bidirectional model synchronization" (very technical paper)
\subsection{DSL}
\subsection{MVD}
