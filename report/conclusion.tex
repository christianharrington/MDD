\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
As evaluated in Section \ref{sec:evaluation}, the requirements for a partial editor prototype set forward in Section \ref{subsec:requirements}, have been met. Furthermore, the correctness of the output has been verified with an account for threats to validity. Finally, a plan for future BIM-related projects has been presented, assisting the ITU research initiative Energy Futures in increasing their understanding of this problem domain. We conclude that editing on a subset of an IFC model is feasible using modern modelling tools.
