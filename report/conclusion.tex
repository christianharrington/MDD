\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
As evaluated in Section \ref{sec:evaluation} the requirements for a prototype partial editor of a subdomain of IFC, set forward in Section \ref{subsec:requirements}, have been met. Furthermore, the correctness of the output has been verified with an account for threats to validity. Finally, a plan for future BIM-related projects has been presented, assisting the ITU research initiative, Energy Futures, in increasing their understanding of this problem domain.
