\section{Introduction}
Building Information Modelling (BIM) is the process of modelling various physical and functional aspects of a building. Currently, many BIM software products exist. These let a user model and analyse the many interactions between different parts of a building. Many of these software products use common file formats for modelling buildings, such as Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) or Green Building XML (gbXML). These formats were invented as industry standards to help improve interoperability between different software packages in different domains, and as such cover many different systems.

In a real-life scenario engineers usually work on separate parts of a building model using advanced visual tools such as Revit\cite{revit12}. Any real model produced with BIM products is huge by nature due to the complexity of modern buildings. Reading and writing these massive, generated files by hand is infeasible due to the humanly understandable but not humanly comprehensible format of the output files. As described in Section \ref{sec:building_information_modeling} it is desirable to be able to work with aspects of a model such as heating, electrical wiring or plumbing independently for interoperability purposes. In this paper we present a setup, demonstrating that such editing on a subset of an IFC model is feasible using modern modelling tools.

This paper specifically focuses on solving a common problem of combining a construction model with a plumbing model in a manageable way. The solution entails a central server merging and storing a version of these models and a client side enabling the user to edit and verify the metadata and structure of the this new main model. This is accomplished by providing an Eclipse editor allowing the user to get an overview of a subset of the building model in a domain specific language (DSL), called Pipes DSL. By using the solution this paper presents, the user is able to verify that the construction is prepared to handle the plumbing installations. The solution is extensible in several ways and thereby works as a good starting point for future automation and visualization, which will be discussed in Section \ref{sec:future_work}. 

This paper first gives a background of the problem space before presenting a list of desirable features for a solution trying to accomplish subset editing on a large model such as IFC. The solution is described and then evaluated with test buildings and reference to the desirable features. Finally, we present a list of future work to be carried out as well as a conclusion.
