\section{Introduction}
Building Information Modelling (BIM) is the process of modelling various physical and functional aspects of a building. Currently, many BIM software products exist. These allow users to model and analyse the many interactions between different parts of a building. Many of these software products use common file formats for modeling buildings, such as Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) or Green Building XML (gbXML). These formats were invented as industry standards to help improve interoperability between different software packages in different domains, and as such cover many different systems.

In a real-life scenario engineers usually work on separate parts of a building model using advanced visual tools such as Revit\footnote{An overview of Revit products can be found at \url{http://usa.autodesk.com/revit/}}. Due to the complexity of most BIM projects, the IFC files grow big and incomprehensible for humans to read or edit, and effectively a challenge for software that wants to work with the models. As described in Section \ref{sec:building_information_modeling} it is desirable to be able to work with aspects of a model such as heating, electrical wiring or plumbing independently. In this paper we present a setup, that demonstrates that such editing on a subset of an IFC model is feasible using modern modeling tools like Eclipse Modeling Foundation (EMF), Xtend and Xtext.

In particular, we focus on solving a common problem\,\cite[pp. 20]{jorgensen10} of combining a construction model with a plumbing model in a manageable way. The solution includes a central server for merging and storing a version of the main models, and a client side enabling the user to edit and verify the data and structure in the target model, that will be synchronized back to the main model, and stored server-side. This is accomplished by providing an Eclipse editor allowing the user to get an overview of a subset of the building model in a domain specific language (DSL), called Pipes DSL. The user is able to verify that the construction is prepared to handle the plumbing installations, and apply adjustments if needed. The solution is extensible and constitutes as a good starting point for future automation and visualization, which will be discussed in Section \ref{sec:future_work}.

This paper first gives a background of the problem space before presenting a list of desirable features for a solution trying to accomplish partial editing on a large model such as IFC. The solution is described and then evaluated with test buildings and reference to the desirable features. Finally, we suggest future work and conclude on our findings.

\label{sec:workflow}
When modeling buildings, the structure of the building and its installations, such as plumbing and electrical are modeled separately\,\cite[pp. 19--20]{jorgensen10}. The structure for example describes which walls are bearing and which walls have openings for electrical wiring or plumbing.  Because of this separate modeling, it is possible for installations to be inconsistent with the structure. I.e. a pipe or an electrical wire could be going through a solid wall without there being made an actual opening for it to go through. This could end up in a situation at the construction site where a planned installation is not possible in reality. It would therefore be desirable if the construction engineer could have an easy way to find these collisions and solve them, by making an opening or moving the installation\,\cite{jorgensen12}.
