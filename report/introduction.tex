\section{Introduction}
Building Information Modelling (BIM) is the process of modelling various physical and functional aspects of a building\cite{clar:eke}. Currently, many BIM software products exist. These let a user model and analyze the many interactions between different parts of a building. Many of these software products use common file formats for modeling buildings, such as Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) or Green Building XML (gbXML). These formats were invented as industry standards to help improve interoperability between different software packages in different domains, and as such cover many different systems.
\paragraph{}
Reading and writing huge, complex XML documents, like the ones produced by BIM products, by hand is unfeasible. It’s desirable to be able to work with aspects of a model (such as heating, electrical wiring or plumbing) independently.(TODO insert reference) In this paper we present a setup, demonstrating that such projectional editing is feasible using modern modelling tools.
\paragraph{}
Specifically, this paper focusses on solving a common problem of combining a construction model with a plumbing model in a managable way. The solution entails a central server storing a merged version of these models and a client side enabling a user to edit and verify the correctness of the merging, so that the construction is prepared to handle the plumbing installations. The solution is extensible in several ways making it a good starting point for future automatization and visualization.

Introduction still missing:
- A hint on how the solution was evaluated and what was the outcome of this evaluation (may be omitted in out case)
- A summary (a map) of how the paper is organized.

Outline:
Feasibility study of whether it is possible to do projectional editing on IFC.

What were the challenges?
- Saving the subset back to the server after editing. Synchronization problem
- Using MPS: it is not a freetext editor. We would want to improve on this later. XText is not flexible enough for this purpose.

Important to mention:
- Ideally this would be a visual editor, but in order to make the project feasible our prototype will use textual syntax - a DSL.
